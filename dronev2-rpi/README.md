1. Create the dronev2-rpi directory in your home directory on the raspberry pi and copy down the few files here to that directory
2. /bin/bash install_rpi_drone.sh   <---- run this. It will install all libraries and set up the pi to auto-run the script that takes photos and (if the tflite model is present) classify those photos and turn on the sprayer
