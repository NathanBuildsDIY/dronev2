The drone is a large print, as is the charger/spinner. I use a Kobra Max printer to create it, use anything that's got a large enough build plate. Files can be printed in PLA or PETG. If PLA all water bearing prints (drone and herbicide cup) must be sprayed to become waterproof. I use flexseal.
You must print 2 copies of the charger/spinner and holders since there are 2 sides (left and right) that hold batteries, and print 6 copies of the battery cage.
I printed everything with 100% infill for strength EXCEPT the drone which I printed at 10% to save weight.
