Remove the USB cable from your cube orange, we're going to try to conn ct to it via the 900MHz radio instead.  connect the battery to your drone to power it up then plug your 900mhz radio into your laptop via the USB port. You may havccc v cto install some drivers for the 900mhz radio via USB or you may have to read a bit on the ardupilot pages about configuration, but for me windows grabbed the drivers and it connected when I had mission planner "auto" connected to the drone, no configuration required    c 7u[ cv  b   v cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc v
