See the accompanying youtube video series on @NathanBuildsDIY channel for details on how to build all of this and get it going - https://youtu.be/KzYfzi7Ct5Y
There are 5 parts

1. Collect parts - 3d print all the files here on a large format 3d printer, buy the motors/raspberry pi/drone parts in the parts list
2. Assemble the drone and landing pad per the youtube video.  See electrical schematics here as well.
3. Set up windows laptop + arduino that's used to control the drone and landing pad/battery swap station
4. Set up the raspberry pi, collect sample images and train your custom image classification model to identify the weeds in your field
5. Create waypoints files to cover your field and deploy the drone to spray weeds!
